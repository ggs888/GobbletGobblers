Hey friends, tried making a simple and fun game. This is based on idea of tic tac toe.

Rules: 
  1. At start there is an empty board of 3x3 size.
  1. Players start with 6 pieces each, numbered from 1 to 6. Each player is assigned a different color.
  2. Goal of the game is to make three pieces of same color appear in a straight line, whosoever does it first wins the game.
  3. Turns are played alternatively. Player can either place one of their available piece:
      3.1 On an empty cell
      3.2 Over other player's piece, which have number less than its current piece.
      
P.S. Number of players and size of board are configurable .

Hope you like it
Cheers!
